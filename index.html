				<h1>Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
				<h2 class="first-h2">Overview and Motivation</h2>
				<p>
					Autonomous vehicles have the potential to benefit society in multiple ways,
					 including safety, convenience, and mobility [1]. In terms of safety, autonomous
					 vehicles would remove human error from driving, reducing traffic accidents.
					 Autonomous vehicles also provide convenience, as time normally spent driving can
					 be spent on other tasks while in the vehicle. Last, autonomous vehicles could provide
					 better mobility for people with disabilities who may have difficulty operating or are
					 unable to operate a standard vehicle. However, one challenge in developing autonomous
					 vehicles is object detection, which is used to detect pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic
					 lights, and traffic signs, to name a few. Detecting these types of objects is a critical part
					 of making the vehicle avoid collisions with people or other vehicles, obey stop signs, and stop
					 at red lights, for example. Thus, the focus of this project is training multiple object detection
					 models for autonomous vehicles and comparing their performance. All the code I wrote for this project
					 is on <a class="decorate" href="https://github.com/ericae9/Autonomous-Vehicle-Object-Detection" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
					 Below is a video summarizing the project.
